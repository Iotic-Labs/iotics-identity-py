# Contributing to Iotics Identity SDK in Python

`iotics-identity-py` is an open source project and accepts contributions.

## Becoming a contributor

The first step is to configure your environment.

## Before contributing code

The project welcomes submissions, but to make sure things are well coordinated we ask that contributors discuss any significant changes before starting work. Best practice is to connect your work to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Iotic-Labs/iotics-identity-py/issues), either by filing a new issue or by claiming an existing issue.
