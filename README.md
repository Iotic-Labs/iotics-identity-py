Create Data Mesh. Use interoperable digital twins to create data interactions and build powerful real-time data products. This repository is a library for Decentralised Identity (DID) management with Iotics for applications in Python v3.8+.

You need to have an IOTICSpace to take advantage of this DID SDK. Contact <a href="mailto:product@iotics.com">product@iotics.com</a> for a free trial or [![sign up](https://img.shields.io/badge/sign%20up-164194.svg?style=flat)](https://www.iotics.com/signup-preview-program/)

## Introduction to Iotics

Interoperate any data, digital twin or service across legacy, on-prem, cloud, IoT, and analytical technologies creating a secure decentralised, federated network of interactions.

Power long-term digital transformation using real-time business event streams. Unlock the power of your business by eliminating complex infrastructure and shortening time-to-value.

To learn more about IOTICS see our [website](https://www.iotics.com/) or [documentation site](https://docs.iotics.com).

## Identity API

The identity API is used to manage identities and authentication in the Iotics Host.
The API is split in 3 level according to the user needs:

* [High level identity API](iotics/lib/identity/api/high_level_api.py): minimal set of features to interact with Iotics Host
* [Identity API](iotics/lib/identity/api/regular_api.py): set of features for basic identities management
* [Advanced identity API](iotics/lib/identity/api/advanced_api.py): set of features for advanced identities management

## How to

Two examples are provided to illustrate the usage of the **high level API** and the **regular api**.
See [Iotics Identity API How To](./how_to/README.md).

You can also follow these tutorials on [docs.iotics.com](https://docs.iotics.com/docs/create-decentralized-identity-documents).
